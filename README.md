# Smoke_Detection
The main objective of this project is to detect the presence of smoke in an environment using Machine Learning.
The project will collect data from a sensor array that includes smoke detectors as well as other environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and particulate matter concentrations. The collected data will be used to train and test machine learning models to detect the presence of smoke in indoor environments.

The results of this project can be used to inform the design of more effective and efficient smoke detection systems. Such systems can be deployed in a range of applications, including building automation, safety monitoring, and air quality management. By improving smoke detection accuracy, the proposed system can potentially save lives and reduce property damage caused by fires.
